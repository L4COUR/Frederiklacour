<body><h1>About</h1>
<p>Currently studying a BA in Digital Design under the Arts and humanities faculty at Aarhus University. In the main courses, we focus on human interaction in relation to digital technology and how these Interactions affects our society at large. Through my education, I have been engaging in a practice of aesthetic programming in which software programs such as p5.js, Supercollider and Max/MSP/Jitter is utilized in a creative, conceptual and critical design practice. Moreover we learn programming within the Arduino environment, and further into the realm of physical computing, however seen from the perspective of the designer rather than the electrical engineer.</p>
<p>Alongside my study, I have a particular interest in audio-design and modular synthesis. I have been using Ableton Live actively since 2016 in creating electronic music, soundscapes, collaborative music and live performances.</p>
<p>I find that it is quite interesting when you are able to combine what you already love doing with what you are studying, this combination has led me to places, that I did not think possible.</p>
